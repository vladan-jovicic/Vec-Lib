## Usage
The Vectrabool is made in a way that anyone can use it. You can use it as a [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) plugin or to use Vectrabool's simple GUI. 

## Gimp plugin - three easy steps usage
You can install Vectrabool as gimp plugin (please check the [source](https://github.com/vladan-jovicic/Vec-Lib) for a instructions). We call it three easy steps usage since it is enough to:
- load an image
- apply filter called Vectrabool
- export it to svg file

## Vectrabool GUI
There is also a simple GUI for a more advenced use of Vectrabool. It allows to keep track of each step (check About page for all steps). Also, an user of Vectrabool can modify result in each step in order to obtain a better result. This includes:
- redefining contours
- adding or removing corners
- modifying an approximated curve
- changing the color of regions

The Vectrabool's GUI is still under construction. It will be released soon.
