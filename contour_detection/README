The contour detection is used as follows :
	- Compile with "compile_opencv.sh"
	- run : ./contourDetection img (threshold) (-d)
	   img is the valid image input
	   threshold an optional argument for the lower threshold to use by the Canny algorithm, it must be an integer in between 0 and 100
	   -d is the option to use dilatation or not (NOTE : IT WAS USED ALL THE TIME IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION).


Steps of contour detection :
 
	1- Apply a gaussian blur of size 5*5 on the image in input, with a sigma defined in the .h
 
	2- Use openCV Canny algorithm to detect contours (@see http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/canny_detector/canny_detector.html)
 
	3- Apply a dilatation on the result image (@see http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/erosion_dilatation/erosion_dilatation.html) to get thicker edges
 
	4- Call openCV findContours function (@see http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/structural_analysis_and_shape_descriptors.html?highlight=findcontours#findcontours) 
 
	contours is a vector of vector of points. It is the data structure that contains the list of contours.
	hierarchy is a vector of vectors of 4 integers each.
 		hierarchy[i][0] is the next contour in the same hierarchy level of i
 		hierarchy[i][1] is the previous contour in the same hierarchy level of i
 		hierarchy[i][2] is the first child contour of i
 		hierarchy[i][3] is the parent contour of i
 

The contours are finally printed on the standard output as a list of points separated by the character '#', one contour per line.
